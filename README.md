## The after-dinner
I really enjoy to listen Alessandro Babero, one of the most famous and popular italian historical researcher. I am very courios about the past, I love to understand the reasons behind any kind of social, economica and scientific evolution. ```If you know the past, you will understand better the present, and predict the future.```
